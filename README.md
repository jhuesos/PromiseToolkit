Implementation of Promise pattern in JavaScript using TDD
======================

Simple implementation of Promise I've made just to understand better the way that pattern works. It also helped me to
understand better the way to do Asynchronous Unit Tests using JsTestDriver and practise a little more TDD.

It's not intended to be a perfect implementation, but in any case, if you want to use it and you found any bug or part
that it can be improved, feel free to make a pull request or to contact me.
